# I Love GPU's 
I have decided to perform the coding and answers to the questions for the assignment in google collab. 
Why have I done this when there is a nice git classrooms? 
Well I see the benefits of this but I also am relying on a lot of things to perform correctly and go right that I have no control over 
if I am to code in that environment. Also from doing my thesis I decided to subscribe to Google colab pro ($$$$$$$)

Which gives me access to more powerful GPU's and means I also have experience in it. Overall it is not the best but nice and familiar
to use for this assignment.
