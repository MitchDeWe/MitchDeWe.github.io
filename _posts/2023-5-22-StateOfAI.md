# The Unprecedented Power of Neural Netorks
AI has almost become part fo pop-culture with the realse of chatGPT and midjourney to name a few.
In my opinoin this excel of AI is basically due to the recent development in the power of neural networks. 
The rise in prominance and development of these neural networks can be accredited to:

* The access to massive amounts of information (images, graphs etc.)
* The access to enormous computing power
* Optimization of model training methods

With the awesome things that AI is now able to do it is almost impossible for the general public not to notice and 
its popularity to rise.
