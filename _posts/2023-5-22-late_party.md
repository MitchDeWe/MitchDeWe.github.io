# Feeling a little late to this party
I am feeling like I am starting this assignment a little later than I would like however this is because I have been doing my bachelors thesis which should be of assistance here.
In the thesis I used a lot of the things here like docker, VScode and created a neural network on a dataset. 
The network is a 2D+1 CNN (it processes 2D images from a video over a 1D convolution of time) based on [MoViNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11511).
Here is the confusion marix showing the results and flexing some of the Markdown syntax to insert an image (wow what a cool matrix, man I wish that the headings didn't get cut):

I am hopeful that this experience will make this assignment easier!
